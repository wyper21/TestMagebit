# TestMagebit Task1 and Task2

All what you need to do, it's download 'MagebitTask1and2' repository and open index.html in your browser.

# Task3 in folder magebit

To open task 3 locally, you need to have at least a local server like Xampp, OpenServer or something like that. You need to create a database in there with the name 'magebit' and create a table. User should be 'root' and password ''. Code for table creation is in file magebit.sql. And if you've done fine everything should work.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
